# Bike Sharing Assignment
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system. We have to build a linear regression model for the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

### Situation : 
-   A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.

It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.

### Task : 
- Create a model to predict the count of a new bike shares.

### Action : 
- Create a Linear Regression Model.

### Result
- Season is the most important factor even Top 3 features contributing significantly towards are Atemp,summer (denote summer season or not) and winter (denote winter season or not)
